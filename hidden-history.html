                        The city of New York, which is recognized as a city of opportunities, is frequently
well-known for its significant development and social diversity, as well as the
number of stories that have been told during its history of five hundred years.
There is a significant portion of the city's history that has been buried beneath the
surface of the city's landscape, and the historical events have experienced a decline
in visibility as time has progressed. The group of people who originally inhabited
this area, as well as the African community, who made significant contributions to
this city but have been mostly forgotten. Through my visits to the "National
Museum of the American Indian" and the "African Burial Ground National
Monument," I have been able to acquire and gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the contributions that they have made. For the aim of better
organizing this article and providing a more in-depth understanding of the ways in
which colonialism and racial inequality have impacted the city and our community, I
will be using a few readings, articles and academic resources published by
universities, and well-known authors to better structure this article.

                        Upon entering the National Museum of the American Indian, which is located in
lower Manhattan, I was surrounded by the powerful energy of the rich culture and
history of the Native American tribes, particularly the Lenape community, which had
resided in the New York City area for thousands of years. It is not only the social
and cultural wealth of Native American life that is revealed by the museum, but also
the fact and manner in which their past has been commercialized throughout the
course of time. In the past few decades, especially during the world war periods,
Native American culture was being repackaged for commercial consumption and
being used to raise funds with their "Native American Spirit" which may track
consumer's consumption desire due to its scarcity in a white dominant society. As
observed by Navratil, a student at the City University of New York. "A substantial
number and variety of gallery and museum shows staged in New York City
in this period raised awareness of and appreciation for indigenous art …
leading to wider incorporation of Native American production into modern
U.S. domestic interiors and to take-offs on Native American motifs and
materials in furniture and fashion design." (Navratil, p. 2). The real cultural
and spiritual importance of Native American artifacts and arts was frequently buried
as a result of these commercial movements, which reduced them to simple symbols
for advertising commercial products and being used in the fashion industry. Another
historian, Levine, draws attention to the fact that the Lenape people are actually
historically connected to a few of the most famous landmarks in New York City
located in lower Manhattan. According to the introduction paragraph of Levine
(2018), "From Bowling Green to Broadway, although the Lenape strove to
'walk so gently on the earth,' without leaving an impact on the land, they
influenced the city's physical geography in ways we can see and feel
today" (Levine 2018 Intro Paragraph)" The National Museum of American
Indian illustrates the difficulties and challenges that Native American communities
have faced in the past and continue to face today. One example of this is the
migration of Lenape towns in the New York area that are forced to leave the island
of Manhattan and move somewhere else. Since the settlement of colonizers from
Europe to North America during the 17th century, the life of Lenape people have
been gradually being pressured. Lenape's land has been taken over, and their
community are forced to move elsewhere due to the sign of unequal treaties with
the Europeans and the disease such as smallpox from Europe continent.
Additionally, the museum highlights the Native American communities' unique
sovereignty and cultural identity. Using the Lenape exhibit as an example, it has
created significant cultural ties to this region such as their sense of sovereignty with
the land and their own cultural identity including their own language and artistic
artifact particularly to the island of Manhattan.

                        My connection to the Native American community has been deeply enhanced after
my visit to the National Museum of the American Indian located in Alexander
Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan. The museum thoughtfully
planned the native american exhibits and brought to life their vibrant culture
histories and contribution to this land. Additionally, my visit has also caused me to
reevaluate and reflect on the ways in which the development of New York City, a
global hub for modernity and progresses that has frequently obscured the
indigenous past.

                        As an international student studying in the United States who comes from a country
with a single ethnic group. My understanding of the concept of racism was limited
and at some times easily to be confused. But over the course of my history study, I
have gradually gained a deeper understanding of the racial injustices problems that
have occurred throughout the history of the African American community and by
visiting the African Burial Ground National Monument, I have further expanded my
knowledge and perspective on these critical issues.

                        In terms of racism, the achievements made by African populations in New York
have been mostly ignored and forgotten by today's U.S. society where white
population forms up around seventy five percent of the total population. One of the
arguments put forward by Blakey, an American Anthropologist, is that "At New
York's eighteenth-century African Burial Ground the careful burial of the
dead is obvious evidence of Africans' continued belief in their own
humanity against European objections (Blakey, p. S187)" This memorial is
not merely a tourist attraction or a basic structure; rather, it is a monument that
brings to light the sad history of racism directed toward African communities. It
serves more as a reminder and a symbolic representation of those African
Americans who have made contributions to the city and to the United States of
America as a whole. By understanding the importance of African Burial Ground, it's
clear that acknowledging such histories helps combat the invisibility and
marginalization endured by African populations. It is not only about preserving
memories, but also about actively engaging with past injustices. The African Burial
Ground stands as a testament to the resilience of a community that refused to let
their narratives be erased. With proper recognition and scholarly attention, these
histories can inform contemporary discussions on race, equity, and social justice.
Just as Blakey stated, "By operating consistently with principles of informed
consent, the African Burial Ground Project, 1992–2009, was the first
ethical bioarchaeological project in which scientific methods and human
rights were made complementary. (Blakey, p. S190)

                    <p>
                        It is plausible that the incorporation of these historical narratives into contemporary
                        education and urban design could lead to a greater level of societal awareness and
                        inclusivity, by guaranteeing that the voices of underrepresented communities are
                        not wiped or disregarded from the annals of history. The history of enslaved
                        Africans and native Lenape, who made significant contributions to today's New York
                        City but have been forgotten over the course of time, was brought to light by
                        institutions such as these museums. Just like Peterson from Black Gotham
                        once said, "these understandings led them to the unswerving conviction
                        that beyond cultural difference lay the universal, ethical value of character
                        that all human beings needed to cultivate (Peterson, p.43).By combining
                        those historical narratives into engagement topics and educational articles, our
                        society can form a more inclusive public memory of the past. By doing so is not
                        only acknowledging the profound and contribution of these communities to New
                        York City's cultural fabric, but also giving us power to challenge the mistaken myth,
                        adapt with the uncomfortable truth from the past, and strive towards a more
                        inclusive and equal society in nowadays' rapidly changing world.
