                        The city of New York, which is recognized as a city of opportunities, is well-known
for its significant development and social diversity, as well as the number of stories
that have been told during its history of five hundred years. There is a significant
portion of the city's history that has been buried beneath the surface of its
landscape; numerous significant historical events have declined in visibility and
awareness as time has progressed. Indigenous groups who originally inhabited this
land, as well as the African-American community whose presence was so vital to
the growth of the city have been mostly erased. Through my visits to the National
Museum of the American Indian and the African Burial Ground National Monument,
I have been able to acquire and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the
contributions of these groups. I will be analyzing anthropologist Michael Blakey’s
“Archaeology Under the Building Light of Race” and Emily Schuchardt Navratil’s
“Native American Chic”, in order to provide a more in-depth understanding of the
ways in which colonialism and racial inequality have impacted the city and our
community.

                        Upon entering the National Museum of the American Indian in lower Manhattan, I
was surrounded by the powerful energy of the rich culture and history of the Native
American tribes. The museum is located in what was formerly the Alexander
Hamilton U.S. Custom House, ironically situated in that Indigenous communities are
the original inhabitants of this land. Particularly, the museum focused on the Lenape
community, which had resided in the New York City area for thousands of years.
Not only is the social and cultural wealth of Native American life revealed by the
museum, but also the fact and manner in which their past has been commercialized
throughout the course of time. In the past few decades, especially during the world
war periods, Native American culture was repackaged for commercial consumption.
Their culture was leveraged to raise funds through "Native American Spirit", which
may track consumer's consumption desire due to its scarcity in a white dominant
society. As observed by Navratil, a scholar at the City University of New York: "A
substantial number and variety of gallery and museum shows staged in New York
City in this period raised awareness of and appreciation for indigenous art … leading
to wider incorporation of Native American production into modern U.S. domestic
interiors and to take-offs on Native American motifs and materials in furniture and
fashion design" (Navratil 2). The real cultural and spiritual importance of Native
American artifacts and arts was frequently buried as a result of these commercial
movements, reducing them to simple symbols for advertising commercial products
in the fashion industry. Historian, Lucie Levine, draws attention to the fact that the
Lenape people are actually historically connected to a few of the most famous
landmarks in New York City located in lower Manhattan. Their impact can be felt in
the way the city took structure, "from Bowling Green to Broadway, although the
Lenape strove to ‘walk so gently on the earth,’ … they influenced the city’s physical
geography in ways we can see and feel today” (Levine 1). The National Museum of
American Indian illustrates the difficulties and challenges that Native American
communities have faced in the past and continue to face today. In the 17th century,
the Lenape people were forced to leave the island of Manhattan and move to
neighboring areas. Since the settlement of colonizers from Europe to North America
during the 17th century, the Lenape people have been gradually scratched out of
history, through their forced migration. Lenape land has been taken over through
unequal treaties with the Europeans and diseases such as smallpox spread from
Europe continent. Using the Lenape exhibit, the National Museum of American
Indian has created significant cultural ties to this region such as a sense of
sovereignty with the land, and their own cultural identity including language and
artistic artifact particular to the island of Manhattan.

                        My connection to the Native American community has been deeply enhanced after
my visit to the National Museum of the American Indian. The museum thoughtfully
planned Native American exhibits and brought to life their vibrant culture histories
and contribution to this land. Additionally, my visit has also allowed me to
reevaluate and reflect on the ways in which the development of New York City, a
global hub for modernity and progresses, has frequently obscured the indigenous
past.

                        As an international student studying in the United States, coming from a country
                        with a single ethnic group, my understanding of the concept of racism was limited
                        and at times and easily confused. Over the course of my time in New York in
                        conjunction with my studies, I have been exposed to more of the impacts of racial
                        injustice, specifically in the United States. Similar to my experience with the
                        National Museum of the American Indian, I have gradually gained a deeper
                        understanding of racial injustices faced by the African American community. After
                        visiting the African Burial Ground National Monument, I have further expanded my
                        knowledge and perspective on these critical issues.

                        The achievements made by African populations in New York have been mostly
ignored and forgotten by contemporary U.S. history. This whitewashing has
occurred because of “othering” of a minority group, where the US white population
forms up around seventy five percent of the country. One of the arguments put
forward by Blakey, an American Anthropologist, is that “At New York’s
eighteenth-century African Burial Ground the careful burial of the dead is obvious
evidence of Africans’ continued belief in their own humanity against European
objections” (Blakey S187). This memorial is not merely a tourist attraction or a
basic structure; rather, it is a monument that brings to light the sad history of
racism directed toward African communities. It serves more as a reminder and a
symbolic representation of those African Americans who have made contributions to
the city and to the United States of America as a whole. By understanding the
importance of the African Burial Ground, it’s clear that acknowledging such histories
helps combat the invisibility and marginalization endured by African populations. It
is not only about preserving memories, but also about actively engaging with past
injustices. The African Burial Ground stands as a testament to the resilience of a
community that refused to let their narratives be erased. With proper recognition
and scholarly attention, these histories can inform contemporary discussions on
race, equity, and social justice. Just as Blakey demonstrates, “by operating
consistently with principles of informed consent, the African Burial Ground Project,
1992–2009, was the first ethical bioarchaeological project in which scientific
methods and human rights were made complementary (Blakey S190)”. That it
often discourses surrounding race are not taken seriously or being delegitimized; in
order to proactively combat this, Blakey shows the significance of science and
fighting against injustice working in tandem with one another.

                        The incorporation of the historical narratives of the Lenape and African American
                        communities into contemporary education will allow a greater level of societal
                        awareness and inclusivity. The voices and impact of these underrepresented groups
                        are felt throughout the culture of New York City, as literally as its urban design, and
                        should not be wiped or disregarded from the course of history. Author of Black
                        Gotham, Carla Peterson, sheds light on the spirit and resilience of historically
                        erased communities’ lasting impacts. Only when viewing history intersectionality,
                        “beyond cultural difference lay the universal, ethical value of character that all
                        human beings needed to cultivate (Peterson 43). The history of enslaved Africans
                        and Native Lenape, who made significant contributions to the contemporary
                        landscape of New York City, but have been forgotten over the course of time, has in
                        part been brought to light by institutions such as museums. By engaging with
                        historical narratives and educational articles, our society can form a more inclusive
                        public memory of the past. By doing so is not only acknowledging the profound
                        contributions of these communities to New York City’s cultural fabric, but also giving
                        us power to challenge the mistaken myths. As society reckons with uncomfortable
                        truths from the past, we must adapt with it and strive towards a more inclusive and
                        equal society.
